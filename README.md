# FizzBuzz

This is a classic beginner-level Python problem called **FizzBuzz**, commonly used in interviews and coding challenges.

## Description

The program prints numbers from **1 to 100**, but:

- If a number is divisible by **3**, it prints `"Fizz"`
- If a number is divisible by **5**, it prints `"Buzz"`
- If a number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, it prints `"FizzBuzz"`
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.

## Example Output
